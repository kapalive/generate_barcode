Generate Barcode UPC
You'll need to install this library first if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:
  pip install python-barcode

Make sure to replace "123456789012" with your unique numeric code for the item. When you run this script, it will generate a UPC-A barcode image named "item_upc.png" in the same directory as the script.
